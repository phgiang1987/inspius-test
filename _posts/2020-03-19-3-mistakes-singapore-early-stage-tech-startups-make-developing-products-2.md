After 7 years helping Singapore early-stage startups to with their tech product development, our team have seen all kind of situations that can appear during the development phase:

These are the struggle that many early-stage startups face with their new tech products. If your company are **developing or planning to develop a Tech product,** below are **the three most common mistakes startups make developing their tech products so you can try to avoid:**



## 1. **Overhead planning**

By **planning**, we are talking about **the process of how you are moving from ideation to the practical development of your tech product**. A perfect plan should be one that maps every possibility out from the beginning to the end, and stakeholders can follow through the end.

However, Reality is **unpredictable**, **your plan can be off-track** by random factors that you have no control whatsoever:

  * Government new regularity
  * Competitors&#8217; new release
  * Natural disasters that sift users habit
  * Etc.

It varies from case to case, but most of the time startups do not have the resource to waste in fail attempts. **What we need to focus on instead of spending time on lengthy planning are**:

  * Produce a plan for a non-perfect product with basic functions
  * Early release for early customers feedback
  * Prioritizing functions that brings the most value to your customers
  * Getting early sales on the customer segment that benefit the most by what your products can offer at the moment.

## 2. **Goal mismatch between teams (business vs tech)**

A fight fired up in your weekly meeting between the software engineering team and the operation or sales team?

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    Developers: &#8220;This software/function is exactly what you asked us to develop. What do you mean you cannot work with it, and we have to do it again?&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Business team: &#8220;It is as described. However, you got it wrong. What we need is …&#8221;
  </p>
</blockquote>

Sounds familiar enough? The conversation we’re seeing here is similar to what **Bill Pfleging writes in his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Geek-Gap-Technology-Professionals-Understand/dp/1591024153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Geek Gap: Why Business And Technology Professionals Don&#8217;t Understand Each Other And Why They Need Each Other to Survive.</a>**

The idea Bill gives us is that **the geeks** (technical people, developers) are **project types, solving puzzles and once they finish, they will hand over to the suits** (business people). While **the suits do not care what puzzles the geeks solved, the final product has to be useful and sellable**. Different goals between the geeks and the suits create a gap in communication and expectation that threaten the success of a project. The final product sometimes technically works but can not be sold to common users.

As a startup with limited finances and times, mismatches can cost you a great portion of your resource. It is your job as a founder to build a process that can greatly limit opportunities for mismatch to appear.

## 3. **Unorganized / not-optimized tech product development process**

**Startups build things from the ground:** 

  * The team
  * The process
  * The tactic
  * etc. 

**We learned to create some of them, but most of the time, what we do is improvising with our business**. This is even truer for software engineers who are stigmatized with untidy desks, unkempt hair and all-over-the-place working space (watch Silicon Valley series). 

Take the case of choosing tools for your team. Most of the time, a small software engineering team can make do with Slack (a communication tool), and Asana (a task management tool). However, as the team grows in number and reporting hierarchy, a more formal process is required to serve your process best, ensure everyone is on the same page, and things go as smoothly as possible.

Take our team as a case study, when we were small, and consists of 3 members only, we used the waterfall process, which is the most common and traditional process to manage a tech product development. A request flows from the top to bottom one by one.

<div class="wp-block-image">
  <figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://inspius.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/agile-scrum-vs-waterfall-e1584519530948.png" alt="" class="wp-image-204" width="328" height="327" /><figcaption>A typical waterfall process</figcaption></figure>
</div>

Because the team was small, some of us have to in charge of multiple roles; but things were smooth. Assuming that our process was good enough, we started taking new projects as well as hiring more staff. In just a few months, the team already quadrupled in size; this was when things started falling apart. The biggest three problems we were facing are:

  * **More team members** joined and specialized in a specific step of the waterfall; each of them only worked based on the given requirements and most of the time **did not understand the big picture of the project**.
  * When a r**equest needed to be changed in the middle of development**, **the team was confused** and the request had to g**A request flows from the top to bottom one by one.** again, wasting a lot of time planning and redoing.
  * When there was **an error from the early stages of the waterfall**, it **would not be noticed** until the code was finished and handed to the next steps, **sometimes until the very end**. By then, the good-for-nothing code already consumed a lot of effort and time.

We were struggling to fix these issues and learned the hard lesson that the waterfall model was no longer suitable, we were **naive to believe that what we could improvise our way to growth without preparing a strong foundation for it**.

<div class="wp-block-image">
  <figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://inspius.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ezgif.com-webp-to-png-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-361" srcset="http://localhost/inspius/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ezgif.com-webp-to-png-1.png 768w, http://localhost/inspius/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ezgif.com-webp-to-png-1-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption>source CNA</figcaption></figure>
</div>

When you design your product development process, keep in mind that you are designing the foundation for your growth. Over time, **improvising is harder and the standard process becomes more important**. Want your team to be fast and flexible require a suitable process.

### **In a nutshell**

Now knowing all 3 common mistakes Singapore early-stage tech startups make developing products, you probably want us also to tell you:

  * How to have an agile development plan with a reasonable timeline?
  * How to avoid mismatches between the technical team and the business team?
  * How to create a formal tech product development process that can help your team grow?
